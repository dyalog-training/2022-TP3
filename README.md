# Dyalog'22 Workshop TP3 - Creating, Maintaining, and Publishing APL Packages

This repository contains materials used in conjunction the workshop. Prior to the workshop (to be conducted on 13 October 2022), materials will be added and updated. We hope to have everything in place by the end of September, but there is always the possibility of last minute updates.

After the workshop, the presentation materials (PowerPoint, etc.) will be uploaded.
